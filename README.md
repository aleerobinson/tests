# tests
Just checking in my tests i create to prove how things work

## Sequelize
Will give me the ability to check in tests that have their own defined models
To get running you will need to create an env.js file under sequelize (reference envEXAMPLE.js)

## Transaction > increment primary key
Checked in an example of why wrapping a select statement and create to get the max key will run into duplicate issues since it won't lock the table
